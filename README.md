# qunit-require
An example which shows how to get QUnit and RequireJS to play nice with each other.

For more information, please refer my [blog entry](http://jonnyreeves.co.uk/2012/modular-javascript-unit-testing-with-qunit-and-requirejs/) which describes this setup in further detail, or just dive head-first into the code comments :)

## Running the Tests
Although this example project has almost zero real world value, you can execute the default [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) task to lint and execute the unit tests from the command line.  From the root of the project, issue:

	grunt 

Alternativley, view the `tests/tests.html` TestRunner in your web browser.
